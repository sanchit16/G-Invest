                            The AI Financial Tutor is designed to be your personal guide to the world of finance. Its primary goal is to provide accurate and relevant answers based on a controlled set of information.

                            <strong>How it works:</strong>
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Focused Knowledge Base:</strong> The AI doesn't browse the internet. Instead, it relies on a specific, built-in knowledge base covering the fundamentals of the stock market. This ensures the information is consistent and reliable.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):</strong> When you ask a question, the AI first searches its knowledge base to find the most relevant paragraphs. It then uses this retrieved information to generate a clear and concise answer.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Safety First:</strong> By limiting the AI to a specific context, we prevent it from providing speculative financial advice or generating information from unverified sources. If the answer isn't in its knowledge base, it will tell you so.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        The Trade Risk Percentage

                           When you make a trade, you see a "Risk Assessment" percentage. This feature is designed as an educational tool to encourage mindful investing.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Illustrative Value:</strong> The risk percentage is currently generated as a <strong>random number</strong>. It is not a real-time analysis of the stock's actual market risk.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>A Moment for Reflection:</strong> The purpose of this step is to introduce a moment of friction and encourage you to pause and consider the potential risks of any investment. In a real-world scenario, a risk assessment would involve complex factors like market volatility, company health, and economic indicators.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Educational Simulation:</strong> This feature simulates a step that professional traders often take. It serves as a reminder that all investments carry some level of risk.
